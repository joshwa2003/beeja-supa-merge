# Beeja-Supabase

## Project Description
Beeja-Supabase is a full-stack web application with a backend API server and a React-based frontend. The backend uses Node.js, Express, and Supabase for data management, while the frontend is built with React and Vite.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher recommended)
- npm (Node package manager)

## Backend Setup and Run Instructions
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install the backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. To start the backend server in development mode with auto-reloading:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. To start the backend server in production mode:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Frontend Setup and Run Instructions
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. To start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. To build the frontend for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. To preview the production build locally:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Notes
- Make sure to configure any required environment variables for both backend and frontend as per your setup.
- The backend server typically runs on port 3000 (or as configured).
- The frontend development server typically runs on port 5173 (default for Vite).
- For any additional setup or configuration, refer to the respective directories' documentation or config files.
